# AI Travel Recommendation System 🌍

This project demonstrates how basic AI/ML concepts can be used to recommend travel destinations based on user interests.

## 🔍 Features
- User inputs their preferred activities (beaches, adventure, history, food, etc.)
- The system suggests top matching destinations
- Uses similarity matching and a simple ML model (TF-IDF & cosine similarity)
- Demonstrates AI/ML in travel and tourism

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Collect travel destinations and their descriptions.
2. Convert text data into vectors using TF-IDF.
3. Use cosine similarity to find the best matches.
4. Display top recommended destinations.
